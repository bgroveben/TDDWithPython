"""superlists URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""

from django.conf.urls import include, url
from lists import views as list_views
from lists import urls as list_urls
# The reasoning behind the 'import this as that' syntax is because we are aliasing views and urls.
# This is good practice in the top-level urls.py file because it allows us to import views and urls
# from multiple apps if needed.

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', list_views.home_page, name='home'),
    url(r'^lists/', include(list_urls)),
    # url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
